# task1: which 2027 digital acquisition lines Medienhaus Brückenhafen funds from its acquisition budget

## Draw

Subdomain: Cohort and LTV modeling (retention curves, customer lifetime value), Product Analytics (`retention-cohort-lifetime-value-modeling`)
Analysis type: Forecasting & Predictive Modeling
Answer shape: A ranked list under a cap (every line in the 2027 media plan ranked by its expected 36-month net revenue per euro of planned spend, funded best first until the next line would take the plan over the budget, each line's expected net revenue per start beside it, with the results the ranking rests on)
Weight: modeling: each line's value is a survival-and-revenue model carried to terms and audiences the record never ran (the end-of-introductory-price exit by offer, channel and full price; survival after it conditioned on how much each start reads; a price rise's excess cancellations by tenure over its notice window; later subscriptions by the household), so the work is specification and diagnostics, not assembly; task2 and task4 sat on a hard-to-measure quantity, task17 on a queue simulation (the overuse.weight WARN against task17 is answered there: a capacity queue fed by fitted inputs, against survival and price-response models per acquisition line here)
Data-native sentence: the group's digital subscriptions move only through its subscription system (starts, price periods, cancellations, refunds), while what sets a line's value sits in four other places (the offer catalogue and price list, which fix the price each start steps up to; the analytics platform's monthly reading log, keyed by login rather than by customer; the notice letters of the April 2025 rise, whose cancellations landed before the new price; and the payment-method register, whose fingerprints are the only trace of a household that came back under a new customer number), so a line's history means nothing for 2027 until it is rebuilt from all five.
People: Rosa-Maria Herrmann (head of controlling, owner of the digital subscription KPI standard and of the funded list), Jost Reising (head of digital marketing, owner of the 2027 media plan), Tamara Naser (subscription analyst, whose workbook and note the golden are) (`guard.py names --geo DE --seed 2711`). None appears in the prompt.

Architecture 3, 2026-11-10, a new world. Architecture 2 (Tekenbord, a Utrecht SaaS company's December 2027 ARR commitment) was
spent on the single-total risk: repaired to DETERMINISTIC APPROVE after the platform's holistic audit, it was landed by the
uploaded run's own methods (66.5 of 93 graded weight), because five judgments each moved one total by less than the
honest methods disagree. Architecture 1 (Corvane, tutor-linked member retention) was returned in kind by the project
lead's review of 2026-11-09. This draw moves to another country, industry, dataset and shell, and to a set decision in
which each judgment moves different lines across the budget's cut.
Guard (2026-11-10, registered card): WARN. The decisive pair was redrawn at the draw: (population, G6) repeated task4's
pattern and task7 v7's driver, (population, G9) task10's lineage and mark182's puzzle; (time, G9) is the honest label,
the gap being the 2027 terms and audiences the record never ran and the pattern each start's downstream value against
its upstream cost. Strategy `composition_mix` (the newest starts' reading mix and the 2027 offers against the history's).
WARNs answered: overuse.weight (above); overuse.forum, the group's management board fixes the budget's lines on the
controlling head's list and no rarer forum is true; repeat.deliverables pdf+xlsx against task2 v6, a hospital dictation
audit asked with another question form.

## Results chain (sketch at the draw; figures, bands and pins at stage 2)

| ID | Result (checkable) | Area | Hurried analyst |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | paying digital subscribers at 31 October 2026 by title, reconciled to the finance KPI | assembly and reconciliation | earned by the careful pass |
| R2 | realised 36-month net revenue per start of the July to September 2023 starts by channel, later subscriptions by the same household included | data discovery | narrow look: later subscriptions joined on the customer number only |
| R3 | share of starts leaving at the end of the introductory price for each 2027 offer, at 2026 prices | modeling | earned or partly (offer and channel effects fitted across history) |
| R4 | the change in that share a full price 2 euros higher makes | causal reasoning | method shortcut: no full-price term, or a raw before-and-after across April 2025 |
| R5 | share of the November 2025 to April 2026 starts still paying 24 months after starting, by channel | missingness and measurement | method shortcut: young starts completed on older starts' survival by channel |
| R6 | extra cancellations the April 2027 rise brings by December 2027 among the subscribers paying at 31 October 2026, by title | causal reasoning | method shortcut: the 2025 excess from April on, pooled over tenure |
| R7 | expected 36-month net revenue per start for every 2027 line | forecasting | unfinished chain: carries R3 to R6's shortcuts |
| R8 | the funded lines, best value per euro first until the budget is spent | synthesis | the shortcuts swap lines across the cut |
| R9 | the October 2026 base still paying at 31 December 2027, by title | forecasting | carries R5 and R6's shortcuts and same-account returns |

One-fact test (at the draw): the most useful sentence is "the newest social and partner starts read far less than the
earlier ones"; it rescues R5 and part of R7, under a third of nine.

## Tried and rejected

- Matching new members to the tutor with the most open slots (pricing simulator v1 to v2): every month's new members
  went mostly to new tutors, so history carried the same exposure as AUT26 and the curve landed on the truth
  (0.834 against 0.837 of receipts); the world needs the platform to match new members to established tutors and to
  run with spare established capacity, which it does.
- Twelve-month receipts per member as the decision quantity: the four observed months dilute the move to about
  3 per cent of the figure; the twelfth-charge retention carries it at about 18 per cent.
- Matching new members to the most established tutor with room, where "established" began at four teaching months
  (simulator v9): surge members landed on tutors inside the stopping hump, the spring 2025 campaign carried as much
  exposure as AUT26 and the curve missed it by 17 to 22 per cent on back-test, a search signal; established now means
  nine or more teaching months.
- A spring 2025 campaign of 680 members (simulator v7 to v10): either it carried most of the effect (the textbook
  route failed its own back-test) or it was too small to tell the models apart; SPR25 is now 264 members, too few to
  separate the routes on its own, the textbook route validates on it, and the discriminating evidence is member-level.
- Tutor capacity fixed at hire (generator v1 and v2): established tutors stayed full, so surge and growth overflow
  went to tutors inside the hump in ordinary months, history carried AUT26's exposure and the curve landed near the
  truth (0.301 against 0.303); established tutors now open more slots once past their first nine teaching months.
- A post-rematch uplift and calendar-month seasonality in the process (generator v3 to v6): neither decided anything,
  and between them they moved the graded cost per twelfth-month member by about 1.3 per cent across defensible
  variants, a fork at any useful rounding; both left the process.
- A 50 per cent first-month offer: the discounts were a quarter of the cost, so a deep run that misread the cost rule
  and left them out filed the re-run; the offer is now 10 per cent and leaving it out stays 5 per cent outside the bar.
- Tutor ids rewritten at a 2025 lesson-platform migration: left unnormalised they split tutors, flattened the stopping
  hump and flipped the call (1,274 twelfth-month members), so cleaning decided the answer; ids keep one format.
- A range on the twelfth-month members as an ask: tutor-clustered and member-independent ranges coincide at the
  nearest 50, so it graded no judgment; the cost ranges at the nearest 25 separate at every endpoint.
- Fuller new-tutor rosters to widen the clustered range (caps 26 to 36): one endpoint separated and the shallow routes
  moved to within 6 per cent of the bar; reverted.
- A 95 per cent range on the cost per twelfth-month member: its upper end sat on its rounding line at 4,000 draws
  and its lower end moved with the draw, so the figure was a coin at the nearest 25; the 90 per cent range keeps both
  ends inside their rounding (`checks.py` R7) and members drawn one at a time move both ends.
- An 80 per cent band on each month's total in the workbook: several of its 22 ends changed between seeds at 4,000
  draws at the nearest 50, and at the nearest 100 it no longer told tutor-by-tutor draws from member-by-member ones;
  the workbook carries the monthly expectations only.
- 2026-11-09, architecture 1 (Corvane, the autumn campaign's members carried through their tutors' stopping hump):
  returned in kind by the project lead's review (one hidden constructed factor; the forward cohort was the only one
  built to be exposed, the generator tuned until history stopped carrying the exposure, and every graded figure came
  from one projection). Re-rooted to a new world as a results chain.
- 2026-11-09, stage 3: seat additions from the book's mean growth in users by account age (no account's own drift):
  EUR 0.10 million against the process's EUR 0.49 million, because need growth differs by account and seats only
  ever true up; replaced by each account's own drift, shrunk to the book (24 months), with 12 and 18 months, each
  account's trailing true-up rate and the book's trailing rate kept as rivals.
- Each account's trailing true-up rate as the golden's seat additions (the stage-2 prototype): EUR 0.56 million,
  above every drift form; kept as a rival, inside every band.
- A slower April decay (PAD_DECAY 3.0, PAD_SHOCK 0.10) to push the careful pass's last-three-months Team rate out of
  R3's band: the excess series is too noisy month by month for the golden to tell the forms apart either, and the gap
  stayed about EUR 15,000; parameters reverted, R3 priced Partly for the careful pass.
- The commitment graded at one 0.1 million bin: the honest family's P20 spans EUR 9.79 to 9.92 million (the exit
  model's utilisation form and the seat-addition form move it), so the commitment's band is 9.8 to 9.9 and the draft
  moved from EUR 10.4 to 10.2 million so that the careful pass (10.23) still clears it wrongly.
- The draft at EUR 10.4 million: the careful but hurried pass's commitment (EUR 10.2 million) sat under it, so the
  pass gave the right verdict for the wrong reason; the draft is EUR 10.2 million.
- Credit notes and re-issues on renewals after 1 March 2026: kept beside the re-issues they moved the price line to
  EUR 310,000 and the commitment to 10.0, so cleaning decided R2; the billing errors now sit on 2024 to February 2026
  renewals, where kept they break the renewal pairing visibly and decide nothing.
- The workspace links' end-and-restart dates listed as Layer 1 mess: read without dates they move R3 (1.43), R5
  (1.12) and the commitment (9.7), because the dates are how an upgrade is told from a cancellation; they are
  evidence for R3, R4 and R5, not mess.
- The ask "how much of October's Team ARR is still billed on the Team plan in December 2027": read two ways (the
  October ARR of the accounts still on Team, or their December 2027 ARR, about EUR 0.07 million apart); the prompt
  now asks for the Team ARR in December 2027 from accounts on the plan at the end of October 2026.
- New Business accounts held at their signing ARR to December 2027 (their ramp true-ups and the first renewals of
  November and December 2026 signings ignored): policy 4.2 counts a first term at its service start, every route
  shares the convention, and it is recorded rather than modelled.
- 2026-11-10, the uploaded cut (price rise 1 March 2026, Team minimum 1 April 2026, deal creation falling from 37 to 27
  a month after March 2026, the commitment "to the nearest EUR 0.1 million"): the platform's holistic audit failed it
  on determinism (runs/arch2/holistic_audit.md). The P20 of 9.89 rounded to 9.9, a step met in under 80 per cent of
  outcomes, and rounded down to 9.8; the band with and without the estimation uncertainty was pinned by no file;
  the Team and open-deal figures were stated as ranges at 10,000; and the run's "recent creation" reading of the
  post-March fall made a naive pipeline view fail the draft on its own. Repaired in the generator: the commitment
  defined as the largest 0.1 million step met in at least 80 per cent of outcomes (prompt, policy 5.3); policy 5.2
  files what the range carries; the two note figures asked at the precision the defensible methods pin; the creation fall removed (flat since 2024);
  the price rise and the minimum moved to 1 January 2026 so the trailing year carries the whole step and the padded
  seats; the world re-seeded so every graded figure sits mid-bin at its rounding.
- 2026-11-10, a world with the price rise at 1 March 2026 and the creation fall removed (seed 1107, scratch v1 and
  v2): every trailing extrapolation cleared the golden by 0.08 to 0.5 million only, because the trailing year's new
  Business, expansion and churn ran below the forward's while only the price line ran above; with the rise and the
  minimum at 1 January and the creation trend ended in 2024 (v3) the trailing views clear by 1.2 million.
- 2026-11-10, the exit model without a utilisation term priced as a hurried route: in the March-calendar world it moved
  accounts lost by 60,000, in the chosen world by under 2,000 (the term carries the seat cuts, not the exits), so it is
  a rival inside the bin (SF24), and the pooled route and independent draws carry R4's loss.
- 2026-11-10, the book's trailing true-up rate at accounts near their seats as a rival for seat additions: 60,000 under
  the drift forms in every world measured (it ignores each account's own growth and the ramp of young accounts); priced
  as a hurried route; the drift windows 12, 18, 24 and each account's own trailing rate stay the family, which with
  need growth less dispersed (NEED_GROWTH_SD 0.03) lands in one step.
- 2026-11-10, the pooled renewal route's seat-reduction gap as a structural result: in the uploaded cut pooled rates
  gave 310,000 against 200,000, in the first re-seeded worlds the two coincided; the gap was the cut's mix against
  the history's, not the process. The process now carries it: utilisation at signing drifts down year by year, so
  the forward book's renewals cut and leave more than the pooled history says; the direction still varies by world
  and the chosen seed's gap is asserted.
- 2026-11-10, the common factor of 0.25 the platform run assumed, as a defensible rival: nothing in the records supports
  it and policy 5.2 rules it out; in the chosen world it widens the 80 per cent range by about a third and moves the 20th
  percentile down by under 20,000, inside the step, so it is priced as a route the sentence settles rather than one the
  step separates (SF21).
- 2026-11-10, Team seasonality in the hurried "last three months" route: in the uploaded cut the last three months
  sat one 10,000 bin under the golden because the April shock had decayed to its floor by August; with the plan's
  cancellations running with the calendar (an autumn peak in every year of the history) a three-month window
  carries a season and lands 60,000 to 160,000 under the golden in every world measured.
- 2026-11-10, the two note figures at the nearest EUR 50,000: the win odds by stage and deal age put the open deals' part
  20,000 above the stage-and-staleness golden, so at 50,000 the defensible family straddled a bin edge in the chosen world;
  asked at the nearest EUR 0.1 million the family lands in one bin with margin, the CRM's odds stay far outside, and
  stage alone, which that rounding no longer separates, is priced as a route the CRM's odds carry rather than its own.
- 2026-11-10, seeds 1101 to 1124 scanned for a world whose graded figures sit mid-bin at the new roundings with the
  band's step the same with and without the estimation uncertainty and the pooled, trailing-twelve and stage-alone
  routes outside; 1109 failed only on seat reductions 4,000 from a 50,000 edge, 1115 only on the Team figure 4,000
  from an edge; seed 1126 chosen on the full family.
- 2026-11-10, the uploaded cut (price rise 1 March 2026, Team minimum 1 April 2026, deal creation falling from 37 to 27

  need growth less dispersed (NEED_GROWTH_SD 0.03) lands in one step.
- 2026-11-10, the pooled renewal route's seat-reduction gap as a structural result: in the uploaded cut pooled rates
  gave 310,000 against 200,000, in the first re-seeded worlds the two coincided; the gap was the cut's mix against
  the history's, not the process. The process now carries it: utilisation at signing drifts down year by year, so
  the forward book's renewals cut and leave more than the pooled history says; the direction still varies by world
  and the chosen seed's gap is asserted.
- 2026-11-10, the common factor of 0.25 the platform run assumed, as a defensible rival: nothing in the records supports
  it and policy 5.2 rules it out; in the chosen world it widens the 80 per cent range by about a third and moves the 20th
  percentile down by under 20,000, inside the step, so it is priced as a route the sentence settles rather than one the
  step separates (SF21).
- 2026-11-10, Team seasonality in the hurried "last three months" route: in the uploaded cut the last three months
  sat one 10,000 bin under the golden because the April shock had decayed to its floor by August; with the plan's
  cancellations running with the calendar (an autumn peak in every year of the history) a three-month window
  carries a season and lands 60,000 to 160,000 under the golden in every world measured.
- 2026-11-10, the two note figures at the nearest EUR 50,000: the win odds by stage and deal age put the open deals' part
  20,000 above the stage-and-staleness golden, so at 50,000 the defensible family straddled a bin edge in the chosen world;
  asked at the nearest EUR 0.1 million the family lands in one bin with margin, the CRM's odds stay far outside, and
  stage alone, which that rounding no longer separates, is priced as a route the CRM's odds carry rather than its own.
- 2026-11-10, seeds 1101 to 1124 scanned for a world whose graded figures sit mid-bin at the new roundings with the
  band's step the same with and without the estimation uncertainty and the pooled, trailing-twelve and stage-alone
  routes outside; 1109 failed only on seat reductions 4,000 from a 50,000 edge, 1115 only on the Team figure 4,000
  from an edge; seed 1126 chosen on the full family.
- 2026-11-10, architecture 2 after the holistic-audit repair (seed 1126; commitment the largest EUR 0.1 million step met in 80 per cent of outcomes, 10.0, met in 83 per cent, 10.1 in 69; draft 10.3, met in 36; every naive extrapolation 10.72 to 11.49 clears it; judge DETERMINISTIC APPROVE): measured against the uploaded platform run's own methods (price by size, renewals on utilisation and first renewal, pipeline by stage and time in stage, the Team plan's last three months, recent deal creation), the run lands the commitment and earns R1, R2 and R5, scoring 66.5 of the 93 graded weight (R3 and R7 missed, R4 partly); its two blind spots cancel (lost accounts about 130,000 low without the group term, Team about 76,000 low on the autumn peak). Two world moves were measured and rejected: the Team cancellation peak moved to late winter shifted the golden as far as the route (commitment 10.2, the draft met in 78 per cent); the seat-growth spread restored to the uploaded world's (0.08 a year, monthly noise 0.008) brought back the run's seat-addition miss (routes on pooled rates at 9.8 and 9.9) but spread the honest family over two steps (10.0 and 10.1). The routes table shows why: the five designed judgments each move the 80 per cent figure of a 10 million book by 0.0 to 0.15 million, inside the honest family's own spread, and only the CRM's odds (10.73), independent draws (10.39) and pooled renewals (10.29) separate, all three moves the uploaded run did not make. The determinism the audit requires (the band's contents filed, no added allowance) removes the stacked pessimism that made the uploaded run miss by 0.7 million. The world is spent: a commitment on one total aggregates every judgment below the methods' disagreement. Re-root to a new world in which each judgment flips units of a set or count.
